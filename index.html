      <p>Hi, my name is Ivo. </p> <!-- TODO: could this be section header? -->
      <p> Following <a href="https://github.com/redwedge/plasticneuron.github.io" target="_blank">plasticneuron's example</a>, I think it might be cool to give you some quick facts about myself: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>I'm 25 years old.</li>
        <li>At university, I discovered rock climbing, and it <b><u>changed my life for the better</u></b>. I actually climb at the gym Plasticneuron used to work at, The Castle, about twice a week, although the two of us are not acquaintances.</li> <!--TODO: do underlining and emboldening in CSS? -->
        <li>I work at two music venues, <a title="Bush Hall" href="http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/diy-magazine//diy/Artists/J/Julien-Baker/05-06-17-Bush-Hall/20170605213542-Julien-Baker-Ph-CFaruolo.jpg" target="_blank">this one</a> and <a title="Islington Assembly Hall" href="https://www.accesscard.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/islingtonassemblyhall3.jpg", target="_blank">this one</a>, as a bartender. One of them recently offered me a promotion to manager, but I turned it down because I wanted to focus on coding (so let's hope this works out!).</li>
        <li>When I was 21, I lived and studied in Istanbul for a year. Afterwards I visited Palestine to see my then-girlfriend, who was Palestinian.</li>
        <li>I grew up in Dalston, and went to Stoke Newington School, down the road from Founders and Coders.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="Ruby">Adventures in Ruby</h2>
      <p>Before applying to Founders and Coders, I was learning Ruby. Here are some of the things I worked on:</p>
      <h3 class="project_title"><a href="#" target="-blank">Alarm clock</a></h3>
      <p>I made this after asking a friend what programs he needed on his computer. It didn’t take me much more than an hour, but I enjoyed making it. I like how the project, in combination with my modest abilities, forced me to use and abuse Ruby’s kernel features, like while-loops and the bell terminal output. The alarm clock is a bit ‘hacky’, and for some reason, that makes me proud.</p>
      <h3 class="project_title"><a href="#" target="-blank">Web Guesser</a></h3>
      <p>This was an experiment in Sinatra, a Web Application Framework for Ruby, which I completed as I was finishing <a href="https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html" target="_blank">Learn Ruby the Hard Way</a> and just before I expressed interest in Founders and Coders. I followed a tutorial from <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/web_guesser.html" target="_blank">JumpStartLabs</a>.
      <h3 class="project_title"><a href="#" target="-blank">WhatsApp analyser</a></h3>
      <p class="testimonial"><i>"Wow Ivo, this could really save a relationship"</i><!--<br>My girlfriend--></p>
      <p> The WhatsApp analyser is the most ambitious project I've worked on, by far. It takes a WhatsApp chat exported to a .txt file (press the three vertically stacked dots, then 'more', then 'export chat'), parses it, analyses it according to 17 metrics, and then presents the data in a GUI containing a table, graphs and a bar-chart. It allows parameterisation, which is where the most interesting programming challenges came from. Specific methods were like Codewars katas of various levels. It's working, but unfinished! Here's a roadmap for where it could go in the future: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Running it currently requires both CLI and GUI. I could completely transition to GUI.</li>
        <li>It doesn't currently use Bundler (a dependency management gem) but does requires the gem Flammarion.</li>
        <li>There are more graphable metrics to be added.</li>
        <li>I know of at least one WhatsApp chat file for which the parser throws an error.</li>
        <li>It's currently very long (500+ lines). I think it's as DRY as I can make it, but I would like to separate out component parts into different files and modules</li>
      </ul>
