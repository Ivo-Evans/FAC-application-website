      <p>Hi, my name is Ivo. Here are some quick facts about me:</p> <!-- TODO: could this be section header? -->
      <ul>
        <li>I'm 25 years old.</li>
        <li>I grew up in Dalston, and went to Stoke Newington School, down the road from Founders and Coders.</li>
        <li>At university, I discovered rock climbing, and it <b>changed my life for the better</b>. Coincidentally, I  climb at the gym <a href="https://github.com/redwedge/plasticneuron.github.io" target="_blank">plasticneuron</a> used to work at, The Castle, about twice a week, although the two of us are not acquaintances.</li> <!--TODO: do underlining and emboldening in CSS? -->
        <li>When I was 21, I lived and studied in Istanbul for a year.</li>
        <li>I work at two music venues, <a title="Bush Hall" href="http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/diy-magazine//diy/Artists/J/Julien-Baker/05-06-17-Bush-Hall/20170605213542-Julien-Baker-Ph-CFaruolo.jpg" target="_blank">this one</a> and <a title="Islington Assembly Hall" href="https://www.accesscard.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/islingtonassemblyhall3.jpg", target="_blank">this one</a>, as a bartender.

      <h2>How I came to FAC and why I'm applying</h2>
      <p>I first heard about Founders and Coders at the homeless shelter I volunteer at on Tuesdays. When an alumnus and fellow volunteer, Haydn Appleby, found out I was coding he told me about FAC and urged me to apply. However, I hummed and hawed. I had just begun to code and I wasn’t sure I was ready or committed. He also advised me to stop learning Ruby and to start learning JavaScript, because of JavaScript's prevalence. But I was determined not to give up early, or flip-flop from language to language, and so I was, almost inevitably, going to finish my Ruby textbook no matter what.</p>
      <p>It was only when I was at the end of my book that I looked up and considered the possibilities of my future in programming. I realised that I’d come this far and that I did enjoy programming. My quietly determined mission to get through one book had crystallised into a substantive interest in the field. By now, I was reading about transistors and ripple-adders in my spare time. I'd made a project. It was at this point that I began doing research on bootcamps.</p>
      <p>Because of Haydn’s recommendation, FAC was one of my first stops, and it stood out for a lot of reasons. Firstly, I liked that it was in my local area. Secondly, and more importantly, I liked the <i>ethos</i> of FAC, its positive aims and its democratic, grassroots origins. I was also interested that FAC has links with Palestine, a place that’s mattered to me since, at 15, I did work experience at the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and, in 2016, I visited. All in all, FAC sounded like the kind of organisation I wanted to be a part of. This assessment was confirmed when I attended the pre-application coding meetups.</p>
      <p>In fact, for my whole life, but especially since I graduated from uni (in philosophy), I’ve had serious misgivings about my future place in the job market. Unwilling to go straight into a graduate job for a corporation, I began bartending at a music venue, KOKO, to keep myself busy while I made up my mind. <!--TODO: say something good about bartending here, like 'Bartending at venues is a fun job, but it's hardly for life - apart from anything, I don't think I could take that many gigs and parties. I started at KOKO over a year ago now, and I've spent some serious time reflecting. --> That was over a year ago now, and I’ve spent some serious time reflecting. I’ve begun to look at social enterprise schemes and, of course, I've begun to code.</p>
      <p>Coding is a good choice for me for many reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It equips me with specific, specialist skills, which I can use to do work that helps both me and others.</li>
        <li>Coding requires creative problem-solving and hard graft in equal measure (like, believe it or not, a philosophy degree).</li>
        <li>As a programmer, you cannot rest on your laurels. Your job will force you to continue learning, and so, hopefully, will continue to be interesting.</li>

      <h2>Adventures in Ruby</h2>
      <p>Before applying to Founders and Coders I was learning Ruby. Here are some of the things I worked on:</p>
      <h3 class="project_title"><a href="https://github.com/ievans147/alarm-clock/blob/master/alarm_clock.rb" target="-blank">Alarm clock</a></h3>
      <p>I made this after asking a friend what programs he needed on his computer. It didn’t take me much more than an hour, but I enjoyed making it. I like how it forced me to use and abuse Ruby’s kernel features, like while-loops and the bell terminal output. The alarm clock is a bit ‘hacky’ and for some reason that makes me proud.</p>
      <h3 class="project_title"><a href="#" target="-blank">Web Guesser</a></h3>
      <p>This was an experiment in Sinatra, a Web Application Framework for Ruby, which I completed as I was finishing <a href="https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html" target="_blank">Learn Ruby the Hard Way</a> and just before I expressed interest in Founders and Coders. I followed a tutorial from <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/web_guesser.html" target="_blank">JumpStartLabs</a>.
      <h3 class="project_title"><a href="https://github.com/ievans147/WhatsApp-Analyser" target="_blank">WhatsApp analyser</a></h3>
      <p class="testimonial"><i>"Wow Ivo, this could really save a relationship"</i><!--<br>My girlfriend</p>-->
      <p>I'm not sure it's going to save any relationships, but the WhatsApp analyser <i>is</i> the most ambitious project I've worked on. It takes a WhatsApp chat, parses it, analyses it according to 17 metrics, and presents the data in a GUI containing a table, graphs and a bar-chart. It allows parameterisation, which is where the most interesting programming challenges came from. Specific methods were like Codewars katas of various difficulties. It's working, but unfinished! Here's a roadmap for where it could go: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Running it currently requires both CLI and GUI. I could completely transition to GUI.</li>
        <li>It doesn't currently use Bundler (a dependency management gem) but does require the gem Flammarion.</li>
        <li>There are more graphable metrics to be added.</li>
        <li>It's currently very long, at over 500 lines. I think it's as DRY as I can make it, but I would like to separate out component parts into different files and modules</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Notes and Writings</h2>
      <h3>Notes on specific languages</h3>
      <p>I like to take detailed and modular notes when I'm learning a (programming/markup/style) language. Educational resources are normally like stories, that introduce information to you where personally useful. I like to reorganise this information to represent the logical structure of the language as best I can at whatever level I'm at. For my JavaScript notes, I am indebted to <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">Eloquent JavaScript</a>, a book that I've found really helpful along with freeCodeCamp. At time of writing, I've read chapters 1-5 and 13-15 - and I plan to keep going!</p>
      <p> My notes use MS word because of its collapsible header features - press ^F to find a table of contents. Note that if you want to copy-and-paste code examples, you must manually change " or ' symbols.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ievans147/Notes-and-writings/raw/master/Ruby.docx">Ruby</a></li>
        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">JavaScript</a></li>
        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">HTML</a></li>
        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">CSS</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Data-types in Ruby: a lesson for the beginner</h3>
      <p>This is a short article I wrote to explain intermediate concepts like encapsulation, classes and objects to beginners via the familiar concept of a data-type. It was really just experimental. I didn't publish it because, to be perfectly honest, I'm not qualified to. Nevertheless I think that it's an interesting and probably-correct read.</p>
      <p> Note that it's written from a 'Ruby' perspective that doesn't make quite so much sense from a JS one. For instance in Ruby, although people regularly say 'everything is an object', they categorically do <b>not</b> include methods in that statement. The JavaScript saying, by contrast, is 'functions are first-class citizens'. Because JavaScript is not a fully object-oriented language, it might be problematic to use it as an example of OOP concepts. </p>

      <h3>Faking it Till You Make It With Git and GitHub</h3> <!-- add these to project_title class from Adventures in Ruby, and maybe reduce spacing in that class-->
