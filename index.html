      <img class = "selfie" src="smiley selfie.jpg"/>  <!-- TODO: resize this -->
      <h2>Hi, my name is Ivo.</h2>
      <p>Here are some facts about me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I'm 25 years old.</li>
        <li>I grew up in Dalston, and went to Stoke Newington School, close to Founders and Coders.</li>
        <li>When I was 21, I lived and studied in Istanbul for a year.</li>
        <li>At university I discovered rock climbing and it <strong>changed my life for the better</strong>. I  climb at the gym <a href="https://github.com/redwedge/plasticneuron.github.io" target="_blank">plasticneuron</a> used to work at, The Castle, about twice a week, although the two of us are not acquaintances.</li>
        <li>I work at two music venues, <a title="Bush Hall" href="http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/diy-magazine//diy/Artists/J/Julien-Baker/05-06-17-Bush-Hall/20170605213542-Julien-Baker-Ph-CFaruolo.jpg" target="_blank">this one</a> and <a title="Islington Assembly Hall" href="https://www.accesscard.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/islingtonassemblyhall3.jpg", target="_blank">this one</a>, as a bartender. One of them recently offered me a promotion to manager, but I turned it down because I wanted to focus on coding (so let's hope this works out!)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/ievans147/FAC-application-website" target="_blank">Here</a> is a link to this page's repo. I developed the image slider in <a href="https://github.com/ievans147/static-carousel-test" target="_blank">a separate repo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ievans147/FAC-application-website/commit/1bbe749680dd7cce2bab4984932235fb907ceda9" target="_blank">added it to this page's repo on the 26th December, 2019</a> - these were the days (literally, days) before I knew about branching.</p>

    <section id="why_Im_applying">
      <h2>How I came to FAC and why I'm applying</h2>
      <p>I first heard about Founders and Coders at the homeless shelter I volunteer at on Tuesdays. I had just picked up a book on Ruby, to see whether coding would be something I was interested in. When a FAC alumnus and fellow volunteer, Haydn Appleby, found out, he told me about FAC and urged me to apply. However, because I had just begun, I wasn’t sure I was ready or committed. He also advised me to stop learning Ruby and to start learning JavaScript, because there are more JavaScript jobs. I recognised that this was reasonable advice, but I was also aware that a common pitfall, for beginners, was flip-flopping ineffectually between languages. I did not want to be a quitter. So I logged Haydn's suggestion, and determinedly continued to learn Ruby.</p>
      <p>At the end of my book, I looked up and considered the possibilities of my future in programming. I realised that at this point, I <em>was</em> committed. I’d proven to myself that I enjoyed coding, and that this wasn't a passing thing. By now I was reading about transistors and ripple-adders in my spare time. I'd made a project. I began doing research on bootcamps.</p>
      <p>Because of Haydn’s recommendation, FAC was one of my first stops, and it stood out for a lot of reasons. I liked the ethos of FAC, its positive aims and its democratic, grassroots origins. I was also interested that FAC has links with Palestine, a place that’s mattered to me since, at 15, I did work experience at the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and, in 2016, visited (to see my then-girlfriend). All in all, FAC sounded like the kind of organisation I wanted to be a part of. This assessment was confirmed when I attended the pre-application coding meetups.</p>
      <p>In fact, for my whole life, but especially since I graduated from university (in philosophy), I’ve had serious misgivings about my future place in the job market. Unwilling to go straight into a graduate job for a corporation, I began bartending at a music venue, KOKO, to keep myself busy while I made up my mind.</p>
      <p>Bartending at venues is a fun job, but it's hardly for life - I crave something a little bit more intellectually stimulating, something that requires a bit more of my attention and creativity, and something which is more <em>useful</em>. I started at KOKO over a year ago, and since then I've spent some serious time reflecting on my future. I’ve begun to look at social enterprise schemes and, of course, I've begun to code.</p>
      <p>Coding is a good choice for me for many reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It equips me with specific, specialist skills, which I can use to do work that helps both others and myself.</li>
        <li>Coding requires creative problem-solving and hard graft in equal measure (like, believe it or not, a philosophy degree).</li>
        <li>As a programmer, you cannot rest on your laurels. Your job will force you to continue learning, and so, hopefully, will continue to be interesting.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Adventures in Ruby</h2>
      <p>Before applying to Founders and Coders I was learning Ruby. Here are some of the things I worked on:</p>
      <h3 class="project_title"><a href="https://github.com/ievans147/alarm-clock/blob/master/alarm_clock.rb" target="-blank">Alarm clock</a></h3>
      <p>I made this after asking a friend what programs he needed on his computer. It didn’t take me much more than an hour, but I enjoyed making it. I like how it forced me to use and abuse Ruby’s kernel features, like while-loops and the bell terminal output. The alarm clock is a bit ‘hacky’ and for some reason that makes me proud.</p>
      <h3 class="project_title"><a href="https://github.com/ievans147/web-guesser" target="_blank">Web Guesser</a></h3>
      <p>This was an experiment in Sinatra, a Web Application Framework for Ruby, which I completed as I was finishing <a href="https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html" target="_blank">Learn Ruby the Hard Way</a> and just before I expressed interest in Founders and Coders. I followed a tutorial from <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/web_guesser.html" target="_blank">JumpStartLabs</a>.
      <h3 class="project_title"><a href="https://github.com/ievans147/WhatsApp-Analyser" target="_blank">WhatsApp analyser</a></h3>
      <p class="testimonial"><q>Wow Ivo, this could really save a relationship</q><!--<br>My girlfriend</p>-->
      <p>I'm not sure it's going to save any relationships, but the WhatsApp analyser <i>is</i> the most ambitious project I've worked on - It's currently over 500 lines long (which I endeavoured to make as DRY as possible). It takes a WhatsApp chat, parses it, analyses it according to 17 metrics, and plots/tabulates the data in a GUI. It's working well for every chat I've thrown at it, but, as ever, more could be done! There are some TODOs at the top of <a href="https://github.com/ievans147/WhatsApp-Analyser/blob/master/analyser.rb" target="_blank">analyser.rb</a>, if you're curious. There is also a <a href="https://github.com/ievans147/WhatsApp-Analyser/blob/master/readme.md" target="_blank">readme</a> for getting set up and a <a href="https://github.com/ievans147/WhatsApp-Analyser/blob/master/description-of-execution.md" target="_blank">simplified description of its execution</a> for understanding it. Go wherever - if anywhere - your interest takes you.</p>

      <h2>Notes and Writings</h2>
      <h3 class="project_title"><a href="https://github.com/ievans147/Notes-and-writings" target="_blank">Notes on specific languages</a></h3>
      <p>I like to take detailed and modular notes when I'm learning a (programming/markup/style) language. Educational resources are normally like stories, that introduce information to you where personally useful. I like to reorganise this information to represent the logical structure of the language as best I can at whatever level I'm at. For my JavaScript notes, I am indebted to <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">Eloquent JavaScript</a>, a book that I've found helpful along with freeCodeCamp. At time of writing I've read chapters 1-5 and 13-15 - and I plan to keep going!</p>
      <p> My notes use MS word because of its collapsible header features - press ^F to find a table of contents. If you want to copy-and-paste code examples, you must manually change " or ' symbols.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ievans147/Notes-and-writings/raw/master/Ruby.docx">Ruby</a></li>
        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">JavaScript</a></li>
        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">HTML</a></li>
        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">CSS</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="project_title"><a href="https://github.com/ievans147/Notes-and-writings/raw/master/data%20types%20doc.docx">Data-types in Ruby: a lesson for the beginner</a></h3>
      <p>This is a short article I wrote to explain intermediate concepts like encapsulation, classes and objects to beginners via the familiar concept of a data-type. I didn't publish it because, to be perfectly honest, I'm not yet qualified to (it is also just a first-draft). Nevertheless I think that it's an interesting and probably-correct read.</p>
      <p>Note that it's written from a 'Ruby' perspective that doesn't make quite so much sense from a JavaScript one. For instance in Ruby, although people regularly say 'everything is an object', they categorically do not include methods in that statement. The JavaScript saying, by contrast, is 'functions are first-class citizens'. Because JavaScript is not a fully object-oriented language, it would be problematic to use it as an example of OOP concepts.</p>
      <h3 class="project_title"><a href="https://github.com/ievans147/Notes-and-writings/raw/master/Faking%20it%20Till%20You%20Make%20it%20With%20Git%20and%20GitHub.docx">Faking it Till You Make It With Git and GitHub</a></h3>
      <p>This is a cheat-sheet I wrote for using Git and GitHub from the command line. I followed <a href="https://launchschool.com/books/git" target="_blank"> this short book</a>.</p>
