      <h2>Hi, my name is Ivo.</h2>
      <p>Here are some quick facts about me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I'm 25 years old.</li>
        <li>I grew up in Dalston, and went to Stoke Newington School just down the road from Founders and Coders.</li>
        <li>At university I discovered rock climbing and it <strong>changed my life for the better</strong>. I  climb at the gym <a href="https://github.com/redwedge/plasticneuron.github.io" target="_blank">plasticneuron</a> used to work at, The Castle, about twice a week, although the two of us are not acquaintances.</li>
        <li>When I was 21, I lived and studied in Istanbul for a year.</li>
        <li>I work at two music venues, <a title="Bush Hall" href="http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/diy-magazine//diy/Artists/J/Julien-Baker/05-06-17-Bush-Hall/20170605213542-Julien-Baker-Ph-CFaruolo.jpg" target="_blank">this one</a> and <a title="Islington Assembly Hall" href="https://www.accesscard.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/islingtonassemblyhall3.jpg", target="_blank">this one</a>, as a bartender.

      </ul>

    <section id="why_Im_applying">
      <h2>How I came to FAC and why I'm applying</h2>
      <p>I first heard about Founders and Coders at the homeless shelter I volunteer at on Tuesdays. When an alumnus and fellow volunteer, Haydn Appleby, found out I was coding he told me about FAC and urged me to apply. However, I hummed and hawed. I had just begun to code and I wasn’t sure I was ready or committed. He also advised me to stop learning Ruby and to start learning JavaScript, because of JavaScript's prevalence. But I was determined not to give up early, or flip-flop from language to language, and so I was, almost inevitably, going to finish my Ruby textbook no matter what.</p>
      <p>It was only when I was at the end of my book that I looked up and considered the possibilities of my future in programming. I realised that I’d come this far and that I did enjoy programming. My quietly determined mission to get through one book had crystallised into a substantive interest in the field. By now, I was reading about transistors and ripple-adders in my spare time. I'd made a project. It was at this point that I began doing research on bootcamps.</p>
      <p>Because of Haydn’s recommendation, FAC was one of my first stops, and it stood out for a lot of reasons. Firstly, I liked that it was in my local area. Secondly, and more importantly, I liked the <em>ethos</em> of FAC, its positive aims and its democratic, grassroots origins. I was also interested that FAC has links with Palestine, a place that’s mattered to me since, at 15, I did work experience at the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and, in 2016, I visited. All in all, FAC sounded like the kind of organisation I wanted to be a part of. This assessment was confirmed when I attended the pre-application coding meetups.</p>
      <p>In fact, for my whole life, but especially since I graduated from uni (in philosophy), I’ve had serious misgivings about my future place in the job market. Unwilling to go straight into a graduate job for a corporation, I began bartending at a music venue, KOKO, to keep myself busy while I made up my mind. <!--TODO: say something good about bartending here, like 'Bartending at venues is a fun job, but it's hardly for life - apart from anything, I don't think I could take that many gigs and parties. I started at KOKO over a year ago now, and I've spent some serious time reflecting. --> That was over a year ago now, and I’ve spent some serious time reflecting. I’ve begun to look at social enterprise schemes and, of course, I've begun to code.</p>
      <p>Coding is a good choice for me for many reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It equips me with specific, specialist skills, which I can use to do work that helps both me and others.</li>
        <li>Coding requires creative problem-solving and hard graft in equal measure (like, believe it or not, a philosophy degree).</li>
        <li>As a programmer, you cannot rest on your laurels. Your job will force you to continue learning, and so, hopefully, will continue to be interesting.</li>
      </ul>

    <section  id="Ruby">
      <h2>Adventures in Ruby</h2>
      <p>Before applying to Founders and Coders I was learning Ruby. Here are some of the things I worked on:</p>
      <h3 class="project_title"><a href="https://github.com/ievans147/alarm-clock/blob/master/alarm_clock.rb" target="-blank">Alarm clock</a></h3>
      <p>I made this after asking a friend what programs he needed on his computer. It didn’t take me much more than an hour, but I enjoyed making it. I like how it forced me to use and abuse Ruby’s kernel features, like while-loops and the bell terminal output. The alarm clock is a bit ‘hacky’ and for some reason that makes me proud.</p>
      <h3 class="project_title"><a href="#" target="-blank">Web Guesser</a></h3>
      <p>This was an experiment in Sinatra, a Web Application Framework for Ruby, which I completed as I was finishing <a href="https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/preface.html" target="_blank">Learn Ruby the Hard Way</a> and just before I expressed interest in Founders and Coders. I followed a tutorial from <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/web_guesser.html" target="_blank">JumpStartLabs</a>.
      <h3 class="project_title"><a href="https://github.com/ievans147/WhatsApp-Analyser" target="_blank">WhatsApp analyser</a></h3>
      <p class="testimonial"><q>Wow Ivo, this could really save a relationship</q><!--<br>My girlfriend</p>-->
      <p>I'm not sure it's going to save any relationships, but the WhatsApp analyser <i>is</i> the most ambitious project I've worked on. It takes a WhatsApp chat, parses it, analyses it according to 17 metrics, and presents the data in a GUI containing a table, graphs and a bar-chart. It's working, but more could be done! Here's a roadmap for where it could go: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Running it currently requires both CLI and GUI. I could completely transition to GUI.</li>
        <li>It doesn't currently use Bundler (a dependency management gem) but does require the gem Flammarion.</li>
        <li>There are more graphable metrics to be added.</li>
        <li>It's currently very long, at over 500 lines. I think it's as DRY as I can make it, but I would like to separate out component parts into different files and modules</li>
        <li>I could do some input control, for instance by giving the user the opportunity to re-enter the file location or skip a line if the program throws an error.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Notes and Writings</h2>
      <h3 class="project_title">Notes on specific languages</h3>
      <p>I like to take detailed and modular notes when I'm learning a (programming/markup/style) language. Educational resources are normally like stories, that introduce information to you where personally useful. I like to reorganise this information to represent the logical structure of the language as best I can at whatever level I'm at. For my JavaScript notes, I am indebted to <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">Eloquent JavaScript</a>, a book that I've found really helpful along with freeCodeCamp. At time of writing I've read chapters 1-5 and 13-15 - and I plan to keep going!</p>
      <p> My notes use MS word because of its collapsible header features - press ^F to find a table of contents. Note that if you want to copy-and-paste code examples, you must manually change " or ' symbols.</p>
      <ul>

        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">HTML</a></li>
        <li><a href="#" target="_blank">CSS</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="project_title">Data-types in Ruby: a lesson for the beginner</h3>
      <p>This is a short article I wrote to explain intermediate concepts like encapsulation, classes and objects to beginners via the familiar concept of a data-type. I didn't publish it because, to be perfectly honest, I'm not yet qualified to. Nevertheless I think that it's an interesting and probably-correct read.</p>
      <p> Note that it's written from a 'Ruby' perspective that doesn't make quite so much sense from a JS one. For instance in Ruby, although people regularly say 'everything is an object', they categorically do <b>not</b> include methods in that statement. The JavaScript saying, by contrast, is 'functions are first-class citizens'. Because JavaScript is not a fully object-oriented language, it might be problematic to use it as an example of OOP concepts. </p>

      <p>This is a cheat-sheet I wrote for using Git and GitHub from the command line. I followed <a href="https://launchschool.com/books/git" target="_blank"> this short book</a>.

TODO: resize image files themselves to improve page speed load time. gtmetrix.com tells you that the carousel image entered at 4224x2368 and was resized to 750x420. The profile pic was 2448x3264 to 375x500. gtmetrix laoded a wide screen laptop view. freeCodeCamp recommended serving images which are 2x their CSS pixel size, for retina displays. So I guess that means the carousel images should be 1500x840. I could also, possibly, serve different images for mobiles. It could be something to look into.
TODO: add a thanks for reading! inside a footer tag, and include a nice picture of yourself with someone else.
